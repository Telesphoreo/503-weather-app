# Weather App

To run, make sure you have the dependencies installed. They are in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will then need to put your OpenWeatherMap API Key inside the .env file.

You can then run the application with:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This was tested with Python 3.13
